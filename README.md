js-paint
---------------------------
This project was my simple attempt at learning some things with javascript and an HTML Canvas. It was a fun project, and there are still some things that could be done to make it more interesting.

Features of Note
-------------------------
Within the project you can draw on an HTML canvas, change the color and stroke of your pen, as well as download the image to save for putting on your pinboards.
The downloaded image has a transparent Background.
